# MYHELLOIOT

MYHELLOIOT is a [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) dashboard application inspired in my other MQTT project [HelloIoT](https://github.com/adrianromero/helloiot)
You can use MYHELLOIOT as a MQTT client application to publish and subscribe to topics or you can use MYHELLOIOT as a client platform to create your own dashboard. MYHELLOIOT is a PWA application and it can run on your favorite browser or installed on Windows, MacOS, Linux or Android.

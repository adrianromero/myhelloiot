# MyHelloIoT

MyHelloIoT is a [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) dashboard application inspired in my other MQTT projecty [HelloIoT](https://github.com/adrianromero/helloiot)
You can use MyHelloIoT as a MQTT client application to publish and subscribe to topics or you can use MyHelloIoT as a client platform to create your own dashboard.

You can access the application here: [MyHelloIoT](https://adrianromero.github.io/myhelloiot/).
